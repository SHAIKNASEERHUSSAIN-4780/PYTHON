Python
======

There are there cases
    1. Snake case - The snake case is used to define function with its name where it defines with underscore containing small characters.
    2. Pascal case - The pascal case is used to define
    3. Camel case - The camel case is used to define class names with different names.
        Ex: MyClass

Type Casting
------------

The type casting is used to convert one data type into other data type.
There are two types:
    1. Implicit Casting
    2. Explicit Casting
    Ex:
        a = 3
        b = str(a)
        print(b)
        // output: "3" or '3'
Operators
---------

1. Assignment operator(+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
2. Bitwise operator (~, <<, >>, <<<, >>>, |, &)
3. Logical operator(or, and, not)
4. Relational operator or comparison operator(==, <=, >=, <, >)
5. Arithmetic operator(+, -, *, %, /, //)
6. Membership operator(in, not in)
7. Identity operator(is, is not)

WAP to perform even square numbers without lambda function and with lambda function.
n = int(input("Enter the range of elements you want to print even squares from 1 to ", n))
even_squares_without_lambda = [x**2 for x in range(1, n + 1) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares_without_lambda)
even_squares_with_lambda = list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(1, n + 1))))

Explain how api calling is used between backend and frontend.
API calling helps applications talk to each other and share information easily. Instead of building everything on our own, we can use services that already exist, which saves time and effort. For example, an app can use an API to get weather details, process online payments, send messages, or fetch data from another website. APIs allow data to be shared securely, so only the required information is sent without exposing the whole system. They also make applications work smoothly across different platforms like web, mobile, and desktop. Overall, API calling makes software development faster, safer, and more efficient by connecting different systems and letting them work together automatically.
API calling is used to connect different applications and allow them to work together. It is used to fetch data such as weather reports, news updates, stock prices, and user details from other systems. APIs are commonly used for online payments, login and authentication, sending emails and SMS, and integrating third-party services like maps and cloud storage. They are also used in mobile and web applications to communicate with backend servers, in automation tasks to perform actions without manual work, and in real-time applications like chat systems and live tracking. Overall, APIs are used to share data, add features, and make applications faster, smarter, and more reliable.

Conditional statements
----------------------

1. if statement
2. if - else statement
3. if-else ladder
4. nested if

Loops
-----

1. For loop
   The for loop executes sequence of iterations for definite number. In for loop we cannot modify the condition manually.
   Ex:
        for i in range(1, 6):
            print(i)

2. While loop
    In while loop, we cannot determine the no.of iterations until unless the condition is met. It is a indefinite loop. We can modify it manually.
    Ex:
        i = 0
        while(i <= 6):
            print(i)
            i += 1

Control flow statement
----------------------

1. break
   - Break statement is used to exit loop.
2. continue
   - Continue is used to skip a iteration in loop.
3. pass
   - Currently suspending a function or condition.
4. return
   - The return is used to exit a function and output a value for the function of different data type.
5. try except
   - The try except is used to stop the code from crashing.

Lambda function
---------------

The lambda function is a special type of function which is used to perform the work of a function without defining def and it used when we need to perform the function only once in the code. The lambda function is small, anonymous function is used to write code in small, concise way.
syntax
    lambda argument : expression
you can pass multiple arguments in a lambda function.

map function
------------

The map function is used to perform a function multiple times on a data or iterate data on a function.
syntax
    map(function, data)

filter function
---------------

The filter function is used to perform a condition on multiple data at once.
syntax
    filter(condition, value)

sorted function
-------------

The sort function is used to sort the values in sequential data either ascending or descending.
syntax
    sorted(value)

reduce function
---------------

The reduce function is used to accept multiple values and produce single output based on a operation.
syntax
    reduce(value, function, output)

WAP using lambda function for sequential data types(list, set).

function
--------

Functions are part of code which can be used multiple times in the program. Functions are block of code which can be executed when called. Function are used to perform a task. Function provide ability to organize, organize the program.
syntax:
def function_name(parameters): // function definition
    code
function_name(arguments) // function calling

Types
    1. Predefined function
        - The function that are defined by the developers are known as predefined function. The functions have fixed return types.
        Ex:
            sum(), input(), max()
    2. User-defined function
        - The function that are defined by the users are known as user-defined function.
        - It can have return types as the user defined.
        Ex:
            def hello(), def hi()

Functional arguments
--------------------

The functional are of five types:
    1. Positional arguments
        The values are passes based on there positions.
        def function_name(a, b):
            code
        function_name(1, 3)

    2. Keyword arguments
        The values are passes based on there keyword or parameters.
        def function_name(a, b):
            code
        function(a = value, b = value)

    3. Default arguments
        The values are passed on the function definition is known as default arguments.
        def function_name(a = value, b):
            code
        function(a = value, value)

    4. Variable length positional arguments
        The variable length arguments can accept multiple arguments for single parameter.
        def function_name(a, *b):
            code
        function_name(value, value, value) // In this case we assign last two arguments for the parameter b. * defines the variable length positional arguments.

    5. Variable length keyword arguments.
        The variable length arguments can accept multiple arguments for single parameter based on their keywords.
        def function_name(a, **b):
            code
        function_name(a = value, b = value, c = value) // In this case we assign last two keyword arguments to the parameter b. ** defines the variable length keyword arguments.

OOPS
----

Object Oriented Programming Language is collection of classes and objects. OOPS is a advanced concept in python that can refers where it can deals with classes and objects.

Classes
-------

The classes are the collection of attributes and methods. The classes are used to provide blueprint for the object.In general classes hold the structure and architecture of entity, in python. Class holds blueprint or template for creating objects.

Objects
-------

In general, objects are used as real world entities which we can access through classes. Whereas in python objects are actual values that hold memory to access values using attributes, variables, methods.

Creating a class
----------------

syntax
    class ClassName:
        code

Creating a object
-----------------

syntax
    object = ClassName()

Accessing a object
------------------

syntax
    object.MethodName()

Instance variable and class variable
------------------------------------

Class variable is defined below class name and above method.
Instance variables are created using init constructor, self as a parameter where self help to access the current variables defined under given methods.

class FaceRecognition:
    // class variables
    eyes = "red"
    def **init**(self, name, facial_features):
        self.name = name // instance variable
        self.facial_features = facial_features
    def display(self):
        print(f" {self.name}: {self.facial_features}")

Four pillars of OOPS
--------------------

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction

5. Inheritance
    Inheritance is the acquiring of property from one class.
    Types in inheritance
        i. Single
        ii. Multiple
        iii. Hierarchial
        iv. Multilevel
        v. Hybrid

    i. Single Inheritance
        The single inheritance is the process of one class acquiring property of one class.
        Ex:
            class A:
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")
                def show(self):
                    print("hi")
            class B(A):
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")
            obj = B()
            obj.display()
            obj.show()

    ii. Multilevel Inheritance
        In multilevel inheritance more than one class inherit properties and methods from another class.
        In this level inheritance can be done step by step.
        Ex:
            class A:
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")

            class B(A):
                def show(self):
                    print("hi")
            
            class C(B):
                def print(self):
                    print("hey")
            
            obj = C()
            obj.print()
            obj.show()
            obj.display()

    iii. Multiple Inheritance
        In multiple inheritance one class inherit properties more than one class.
        Ex:
            class A:
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")

            class B:
                def show(self):
                    print("hi")
            
            class C(A, B):
                def print(self):
                    print("hey")
            
            obj = C()
            obj.print()
            obj.show()
            obj.display()

    iv. Hierarchial Inheritance
        In hierarchial inheritance more than one child inherits properties from only one class.
        Ex:
            class A:
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")

            class B(A):
                def show(self):
                    print("hi")
                    
            class C(A):
                def print(self):
                    print("hey")

            obj = C()
            obj1 = B()
            obj.print()
            obj.display()
            
            obj1.show()
            obj1.display()

    v. Hybrid Inheritance
        The hybrid inheritance is the combination of multiple types of inheritance.(single level, multi level, multiple, hierarchical).
        Ex:
            class A:
                def display(self):
                    print("hello")

            class B(A):
                def show(self):
                    print("hi")
            
            class C(B)
            

WAP on theme of face recognition in term of inheritance.
WAP explain about hierarchial inheritance.

Polymorphism
------------

Polymorphism means many forms. In python, same objects holding same method name behave differently in different classes.
Types
    1. Runtime polymorphism
        In runtime polymorphism we use method overriding.
    2. Compile time polymorphism
        In compile time polymorphism we use method overloading.

Method Overriding
-----------------

In method overriding, same methods behave differently in different classes.
Ex:
    class Polymorphism:
        def some_func(self):
            return f"This is polymorphism method."

    class MethodOverriding(Polymorphism):
        def some_func(self):
            return f"This is method overriding method."

    obj1 = MethodOverriding()
    print(obj1.some_func())
    
Method Overloading
------------------

For the same method, we can add as many parameters you want. In python, true method overloading is not supported, for that purpose we use
    i. Variable length positional arguments.
    ii. default arguments.
    iii. dispatch
Ex:
    class Calculate:
        def mul(self, a = 1, b = 2, *args):
            product = a* b
            if(len(args) == 0):
                return product
            for num in args:
                product *= num
            return product

    obj = Calculate()
    print(obj.mul(5, 6))

Encapsulation
-------------

Encapsulation is the process of hiding sensitive and confidential data by providing access modifiers and methods. It incorporation of data and data manipulation from malicious users. It provides three types of access modifiers:

1. Public -> self.name(Can be accessed anywhere in the program and subclasses)
2. Private -> self.__name(Can be accessed only in the defined class)
3. Protected -> self._name(Can be accessed only in defined class and subclass)

For to access the private variables we use two methods.
    i. name mangling -> For to access private variable
    ii. getter and setter -> For to modify the private variable.

Abstraction
-----------

WAP for the theme impose voting platform use encapsulation in it to vote each contestant.
WAP to perform file operations.
